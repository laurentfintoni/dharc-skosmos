<p>Questo repository fornisce l'accesso a tutti i vocabolari controllati creati dal <a href = "https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en" target = "_blank"> Digital Humanities Advanced Research Center</a>, Università di Bologna. I vocabolari sono classificati per progetti e possono essere sfogliati (preferibilmente da desktop) utilizzando facilmente una visualizzazione delle gerarchie concettuali o indice alfabetico, nonché scaricato in formati RDF. L'interfaccia di ricerca consente agli utenti di cercare termini in vocabolari specifici o tutti disponibili. </p>
<p>Il repository usa <a href="http://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos" target="_blank">Skosmos</a>, un open source ontology browser svilupatto dalla Biblioteca nazionale della Finlandia, che utilizza SKOS come data model. Puoi visualizzare l'ultima build del repository sul nostro <a href = "https://github.com/laurentfintoni/dharc-skosmos" target = "_blank">GitHub </a>. </p>
<p>Richieste e suggerimenti possono essere inviati tramite la pagina di feedback. </p>

<p>The /DH.arc Vocabularies repository provides access to controlled vocabularies and ontologies created by the <a href="https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre</a> at the University of Bologna.</p>
<p>The repository uses <a href="http://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos" target="_blank">Skosmos</a>, a web based open source ontology browser developed and released by the team at the National Library of Finland, which uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/" target="_blank">SKOS</a> as the underlying data model. For vocabularies, integration with Skosmos is fairly straightforward as SKOS is a standard for developing and publishing machine-readable and interoperable vocabularies.</p> 
<p>However, ontologies require some additional work to integrate as they are most often based on OWL and Skosmos requires SKOS in order to correctly display files in its browser. To solve this issue we chose to transform the original ontology .owl files into Turtle maintaining the overall structure of the ontology and existing owl notation with the addition of skos notation for integration. For example all ontologies are defined as instances of both the owl:Ontology class and the skos:ConceptScheme class while instances of owl:Class, owl:ObjectProperty, and owl:DatatypeProperty have the skos:Concept class added, in line with the SKOS primer which states this to be consistent. This approach was inspired by a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html" target="_blank">2008 document</a> detailing how OWL and SKOS can be used together including by overlaying the two together. As a result of this approach, ontologies can be browsed using Skosmos, taking full advantage of its interface and functionality while still remaining coherent. All ontologies include a link to their original OWL version.</p> 
<p>All files can be easily browsed (desktop preferred) using a visualisation of the concept hierarchies or alphabetical index as well as downloaded in RDF formats. The search interface enables users to search terms in specific vocabularies or all available.</p>
