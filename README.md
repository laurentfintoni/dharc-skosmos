# /DH.arc Vocabularies

This website provides access to interoperable versions of controlled vocabularies and ontologies created by the Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre at the University of Bologna, based on the SKOS data model. All files can be browsed (desktop preferred) and downloaded in RDF formats. 

The website uses [Skosmos](http://skosmos.org), a web based open source ontology browser developed and released by the team at the National Library of Finland, which uses SKOS as the underlying data model.
